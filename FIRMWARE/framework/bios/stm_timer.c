    \brief Driver for timers in the STM32F10xx CPU.  Currently used for
    PWM mode for the D/A I/P output and also for PWM mode control of
    the digital outputs DO_1, DO_2.  Note: the system tick timer is handled
    elsewhere.

//This 5-bit vector defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are
//done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the
//address of the TIMx_CR1 register.
//Example:
//00000: TIMx_CR1,
//00001: TIMx_CR2,
//00010: TIMx_SMCR,
//...
//Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 transfers & DBA = TIMx_CR1. In this
//case the transfer is done to/from 7 registers starting from the TIMx_CR1 address..
//15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
//DMAB[15:0]
//rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw rw
//Bits 15:0 DMAB[15:0]: DMA register for burst accesses
//A read or write operation to the DMAR register accesses the register located at the address
//(TIMx_CR1 address) + (DBA + DMA index) x 4
//where TIMx_CR1 address is the address of the control register 1, DBA is the DMA base
//address configured in TIMx_DCR register, DMA index is automatically controlled by the DMA
//transfer, and ranges from 0 to DBL (DBL configured in TIMx_DCR).
//RM0008 General-purpose timers (TIM2 to TIM5)
//Doc ID 13902 Rev 13 405/1093
//This is done in the following steps:
//1. Configure the corresponding DMA channel as follows:
//� DMA channel peripheral address is the DMAR register address
//� DMA channel memory address is the address of the buffer in the RAM containing
//the data to be transferred by DMA into CCRx registers.
//� Number of data to transfer = 3 (See note below).
//� Circular mode disabled.
//2. Configure the DCR register by configuring the DBA and DBL bit fields as follows:
//DBL = 3 transfers, DBA = 0xE.
//3. Enable the TIMx update DMA request (set the UDE bit in the DIER register).
//4. Enable TIMx
//5. Enable the DMA channel
//Note: This example is for the case where every CCRx register to be updated
